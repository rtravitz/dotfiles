# Dotfiles

This repo holds my configuration files for some of my frequently used tools:
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
* [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
* [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

Executing `install.sh` from within the project directory will symlink its contents to the appropriate locations on OSX.
*Beware*: The symlink uses -f and will overwrite any file or directory currently at the destination.
