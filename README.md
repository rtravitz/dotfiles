# Dotfiles

This repo holds my configuration files for some of my frequently used tools:
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty)
- [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

### Installation
Executing `bin/link.sh` from within the project directory will symlink its contents to the appropriate locations on OSX.
*Beware*: The symlink uses -f and will overwrite any file or directory currently at the destination.

Executing `bin/install.sh` from the root of the dotfiles directory will brew install packages found in packages.txt.

### Fonts 

I change back and forth between a handful of fonts. Sometimes things start to get samey and you just need to redecorate, ya know? The main rotation is:
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)
- [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack)
- [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)
- [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
